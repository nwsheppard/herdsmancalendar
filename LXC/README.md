# Herdsman Calendar API

A small FastAPI service that scrapes the investing.com economic calendar
widget and serves clean JSON for an ESP32-based terminal client.

This folder follows the same two-phase pattern used by
[Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE)
(e.g. [`ct/bazarr.sh`](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/blob/main/ct/bazarr.sh) /
[`install/bazarr-install.sh`](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/blob/main/install/bazarr-install.sh)):
a host-side script creates the LXC, and a container-side script provisions it.

`install.sh` sources community-scripts' real `misc/build.func` directly, so
running it gives you their actual interactive experience: the Default
Install / Advanced Install / Settings whiptail menu, storage and resource
prompts, template selection, all of it. The only thing rewritten in flight
is the single line inside `build.func` that fetches the per-app install
script -- that line is hardcoded to community-scripts' own repo, so it's
redirected (via a `sed` in the `source <(curl ... | sed ...)` line) to this
repo's `herdsman-calendar-install.sh` instead. Everything else (`core.func`,
`error_handler.func`, `tools.func`) loads unmodified straight from their
repo on every run, so there's nothing vendored here to fall out of date.

## What this repository contains

- `calendar_api.py` — the scraper and API service
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `install.sh` — run on the Proxmox VE host; sources community-scripts'
  `build.func` and drives the interactive container creation
- `herdsman-calendar-install.sh` — run inside the LXC by `build.func`;
  installs Python, fetches the app, creates the systemd service, and starts it

## Quick install

Run directly on a Proxmox VE host:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nwsheppard/herdsmancalendar/main/LXC/install.sh)"
```

You'll get the same "Default Install / Advanced Install / Settings" menu
Proxmox Helper Scripts normally show. Default Install uses the resource
defaults declared in `install.sh` (1 core, 512 MB RAM, 4 GB disk, Debian 12,
unprivileged); Advanced Install lets you override CPU/RAM/disk/storage/
network/CTID interactively.

## Updating

Proxmox Helper Scripts update in-container, not by re-running the host
script: `pct enter <ctid>`, then run `update`. That re-invokes `install.sh`'s
`update_script()` function, which pulls the latest `calendar_api.py` /
`requirements.txt`, reinstalls dependencies, and restarts the service.

## Testing the API

```bash
curl http://<container-ip>:8080/health
curl http://<container-ip>:8080/calendar?range=day
curl http://<container-ip>:8080/calendar?range=week
```

## Maintenance notes

- investing.com can change its HTML structure, so this service may need periodic selector updates.
- The current `countries` and `importance` values are simple defaults and may be adjusted later.
- A cache layer would be a good next step if the API is polled frequently.
